Snake Game Documentation

1. Introduction:
   - This document provides documentation for a Snake game implemented in Python using the Pygame library.
   - The game features a snake that moves around the screen, eats food, and grows while avoiding collisions with walls and itself.

2. Initialization:
   - Pygame is initialized, and necessary colors, screen dimensions, fonts, block size, and snake speed are defined.

3. Creating the Game Window:
   - The game window is created with a width of 800 pixels and a height of 600 pixels.
   - The window title is set to "Snake Game."

4. Loading Assets:
   - The background image and sound effects for eating and game over are loaded.

5. Snake Class:
   - A class named "Snake" is defined to represent the snake in the game.
   - The snake's initial position, direction, and color are defined.
   - The snake can move, be drawn on the screen, eat food, and detect collisions.

6. Food Class:
   - A class named "Food" is defined to represent the food that the snake can eat.
   - The food's color and initial position are defined.
   - A method generates a random position for the food when it is eaten.

7. Score Class:
   - A class named "Score" is defined to keep track of the player's score.

8. Game Loop:
   - The main game loop is defined within the "game_loop" function.
   - It handles user input, updates the snake's position, checks for collisions, and draws game elements.
   - The game continues until the player quits or the snake collides with a wall or itself.

9. User Input:
   - The game captures user input to change the snake's direction (up, down, left, or right).

10. Moving the Snake:
   - The snake's movement is based on its direction and block size.
   - The snake's segments are updated accordingly.

11. Collisions:
   - Collisions are checked against the game boundaries (walls) and the snake's body.
   - If the snake collides with a wall or itself, the game ends with a game over sound.

12. Eating Food:
   - The snake can eat food when its head collides with the food.
   - The snake grows, and the food is respawned at a random location.
   - A sound effect is played when the snake eats food.

13. Drawing Game Elements:
   - The game continuously redraws the snake, food, and score on the screen using Pygame's drawing functions.

14. Snake Speed:
   - The speed of the snake is controlled by a clock, and it is limited to 10 frames per second.

15. Quitting the Game:
   - The game exits and cleans up resources when the game loop ends.

16. Conclusion:
   - This Snake game provides an enjoyable gaming experience, allowing players to control the snake, eat food, and increase their score while avoiding collisions.

Note: This documentation provides an overview of the code structure and functionality. Detailed code comments are available within the Python script for a more comprehensive understanding of the implementation.
